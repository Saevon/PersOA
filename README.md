# PersOA

PersOA is used to match the personality details given on this site (http://rpg.ashami.com/) which provides an interesting way to isolate parts of a person's personality in a character. Thus this would make it easier to try to roleplay a character outside your comfort zone, since you could put together a few of the details, which would expand to fill out the whole sheet over time.

The app is made with a REST API to allow other apps to show and edit personalities. This is made mostly for use with WebDnD, though it does have an admin interface (Django's) so you can edit things there.
